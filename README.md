# Runhead AC

Runhead is a friendly social running club in South East London. We meet every Tuesday at 7:15pm outside [The Beer Shop](http://www.thebeershoplondon.co.uk/) on Nunhead Green for a 7:30pm start, running 4, 5 and 6 miles at a variety of paces. We return afterwards for a drink or two at The Beer Shop
